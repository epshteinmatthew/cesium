# Cesium

Cesium a public database containing approximately 2000 oscillating networks with between three and nine species created using a customized evolution algorithm, an optimization process based on the iterative improvement of candidate models. The source code for the algorithm that generated these evolved models can be found here: https://github.com/sys-bio/evolution. Also within this database are approximately 8000 randomly generated models with between one and ten species. All models are written in Antimony, a chemical network modeling language.
