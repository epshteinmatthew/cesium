Note: a Python package is under construction and should eventually have the syntax listed below. When python package is finished we will need to add the following to the README.md:

## (Unfinished) Python package usage:
- To import library after pip install (`pip install oscillatorlookups`):

  `import oscillatorlookups`
- To get model database metadata in JSON format:

  `myList = oscillatorlookups.lookups.get_metadata()` 
  
  Note: JSON database is very big >20 MB.
- To download all of the oscillatory models with 5 species and 5 reactions:

  `oscillatorlookups.lookup(myList, "osc55/", 5, 5))` 
  
  Models are placed in the ../'osc55' dir, This lookup and download may take awhile (> 5 sec depending on the number of models found.
- To get the number of models with ceratin attributes:
  `oscillatorlookups.get_number_of_models_with_attrib(myList, num_species=5, num_reactions=5)`
  
  This finds the number of models with species = 5 and number of reactions = 5. Currently only attributes 'num_species' and 'num_reactions' are supported.
- Only specify one attribute:
  `oscillatorlookups.get_number_of_models_with_attrib(myList, num_species=4)` 
- Grab a summary of the database:
  `oscillatorlookups.get_summary(myList)`

  Returns a list of strings, each entry gives the number of models with a specific number of reactions and species.
